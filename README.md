# RoomCore
RoomCore is a native messenger written using HTML and CSS languages to create user interface and functionality. In addition, various programming languages such as JavaScript, PHP, and others are used to create the messenger logic.

The system consists of two main components: client and server parts. The client side is a user interface written in HTML and styled with CSS. It contains various interface elements such as chat windows, control panel, buttons and other elements that allow the user to communicate with other users.

The server part is responsible for the messenger logic. It is written in programming languages such as PHP, JavaScript and others. The server part processes all user requests, ensures data security, manages the database and sends messages between users.

RoomCore uses a variety of security technologies such as data encryption, password hashing, protection against SQL Injection attacks, and others. Also, the messenger uses the HTTPS protocol to ensure the security of data transfer between the client and server parts.

RoomCore is also scalable, allowing it to support large numbers of users and handle large amounts of data. For this, various technologies are used, such as caching, horizontal and vertical scaling, load balancing, and others.

All in all, RoomCore is a complex system that uses many technologies to provide security and messenger functionality. It consists of client and server parts that work together to provide fast and secure communication between users.
